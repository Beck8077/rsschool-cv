# About Myself

I graduated MDIS in Tashkent and have a Bachelor's Degree in Business and Economics. After graduating, I started to work as a truck dispatcher for US logistics company which has an office in Tashkent. After realising that this sphere doesn't provide opportunities for career and personal development, I started to gain interest in programming and looking forward to learn new sphere and technologies through these courses.
